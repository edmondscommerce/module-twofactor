Magento 2 Two Factor Authentication module
==========================================
 
This module will eventually provide Google Authenticator protection for both the customer and admin accounts of a 
Magento 2 store.

It will also give me a good excuse to play around with some of the different Magento 2 functionality and testing.

When this is ready, I'll send it across to packagist so it can be downloaded. 
 
For the moment, it is not even close to being complete or functional, so use entirely at your own risk
 
Current Status
--------------

From what I can tell this is now functionally complete, and the majority of tests for it have been written.

With great thanks to Alan Storm and his [travis repo](https://github.com/astorm/magento2-travis) I have the repo set up 
to run tests, and started to put these in place.
 
There is still some testing work to be done on this, as well as refactoring some of the classes that currently do to 
much, and then documenting everything.
