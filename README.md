Magento 2 Two Factor Authentication module
==========================================
 
This module will eventually provide Google Authenticator protection for both the customer and admin accounts of a 
Magento 2 store.

It will also give me a good excuse to play around with some of the different Magento 2 functionality and testing.

When this is ready, I'll send it across to packagist so it can be downloaded. 
 
For the moment, it is not even close to being complete or functional, so use entirely at your own risk
